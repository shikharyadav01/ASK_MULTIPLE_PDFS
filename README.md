🧠 Multiple PDF Chatbot using LLMs (LangChain + Embeddings + RAG)
🔷 Project Title:
"Chat with Multiple PDFs: AI-powered Document Assistant"

📌 Project Description:
This project allows users to upload multiple PDF documents and ask questions across them using Large Language Models (LLMs). It leverages LangChain, vector databases, and embedding models to understand, chunk, store, and retrieve relevant parts of the PDFs for generating context-aware answers.

🚀 Key Features:
Upload and parse multiple PDF files

Text chunking and cleaning

Convert chunks to vector embeddings

Store in a vector database (e.g., Chroma or FAISS)

Use LangChain + LLMs (OpenAI/Gemini) for context-aware QA

Streamlit frontend for chat interface

⚙️ Tech Stack:
Python

LangChain (for chaining logic)

InstructorEmbedding / OpenAI / Gemini Embeddings

ChromaDB / FAISS (Vector Store)

PyPDF2 / pdfplumber (PDF parsing)

Streamlit / Gradio (UI)

Gemini or GPT-3.5 / GPT-4 (LLM Backend)

📁 Project Flow:
PDF Upload: User uploads multiple PDFs.

PDF Parsing: Extract text from all pages using pdfplumber.

Chunking & Embedding: Split into small chunks and convert to embeddings.

Vector Store: Store embeddings in ChromaDB or FAISS.

Query Handling:

User asks a question.

Convert question to embedding.

Retrieve relevant chunks using similarity search.

Pass context + query to LLM via LangChain.

Answer Generation: Return and display answer in a chat-like interface.

💡 Use Cases:
Academic/Research paper summarization

Legal document analysis

Company report Q&A

Resume filtering and HR automation

Medical report analysis

📈 Outcome:
Showcases mastery over:

LLMs + LangChain + Embeddings + RAG architecture

File handling and custom interfaces

Real-world NLP applications
